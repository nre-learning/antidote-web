# This compose file is meant to be used for developing on antidote-web or one of the related projects
# such as antidote-ui-components. By default, it starts a single container for the web front end and
# assumes the rest is running elsewhere. However, if you wish, you can un-comment the additional sections
# below to get additional development-time tools.
